# lineup-calc
This program uses Python and Python Pandas to read in custom NFL Player and Team data (.csv) in order to recommend a lineup for fantasy football for a given week. Objects are created for both players and teams, each with different attributes that lead to different methods when player scoring takes place. The Tkinter package is also used to create a GUI for the program so that the program does not need to be run from the command line.
